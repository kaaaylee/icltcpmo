# icl ts pmo (i can't lie this code piss me off)

**icl ts pmo** is a custom domain-specific language built using [textX](https://textx.github.io/textX/), made for my CS420 (Advandced Programming Languages) class.  
It's an esoteric language inspired by LOLCODE, another esoteric language that resembles the speech of lolcats (old internet meme), and is meant to be humorous and playful.  
The language uses keywords inspired by common online slang and acronyms like "wsg," "ong," "sybau," and "icl ts pmo."
